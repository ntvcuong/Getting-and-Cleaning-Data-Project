#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

##Introduction
This repo contains my course project of Getting and Cleaning Data course of John Hopskin University.

##Steps of the project
1. Download the data source and get the UCI HAR Dataset folder
2. Compose a script to solve the project requests named run_analysis.R
3. Write a codebook to describe the data
4. This README.md to be composed

##The Script
The repo contain 01 R script file named run_analysis.R that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
